# KotlinWebScraper
Project to test web scraping with Kotlin

In this project, I used JSoup to scrap Uri Online
Judge Weekly rank to find a position for a given
user, since in the website there is no such option.

It is an easy tool, just need insert email, password
and name to search. As a result, it will print all
users with given name, ordered by their position
